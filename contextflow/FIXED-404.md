# FIXED: 404 Error Resolution

## What Was Fixed

1. **Removed dynamic import** - Changed from `dynamic(() => import())` to direct import
2. **Added 'use client' directive** - Required for React hooks in Next.js
3. **Renamed file** - Changed `contextflow.jsx` to `contextflow.js` for better compatibility
4. **Added favicon** - Stops the favicon.ico 404 error
5. **Added _document.js** - Proper HTML structure

## Deploy This Fixed Version

### Option 1: Fresh Deploy (Recommended)

1. **Delete old deployment** (if it exists):
   - Go to Vercel dashboard
   - Click your project
   - Settings â†’ Delete Project

2. **Deploy the fixed version**:
   ```bash
   cd contextflow
   npm install
   npm run build    # Test locally first
   npm start        # Should work at localhost:3000
   ```

3. **Push to Vercel**:
   ```bash
   # If using CLI
   vercel --prod
   
   # Or via website
   # Drag and drop the contextflow folder to vercel.com
   ```

4. **Add environment variable**:
   - Settings â†’ Environment Variables
   - Add `OPENAI_API_KEY`
   - **Must redeploy after adding!**

### Option 2: Update Existing Deployment

If you want to update your existing deployment:

1. Delete the old files
2. Upload the new fixed files
3. Push to Git (if using Git)
4. Vercel will auto-deploy

### Testing Locally First

Always test before deploying:

```bash
cd contextflow
npm install
npm run build
npm start
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` - it should work perfectly.

### What Changed in Files:

**pages/index.js** - Now uses direct import:
```javascript
import ContextFlow from '../contextflow'  // Instead of dynamic import
```

**contextflow.js** - Now has 'use client':
```javascript
'use client';  // Added at top of file
```

**New files added**:
- `pages/_document.js` - HTML structure
- `public/favicon.svg` - Stops 404 error

## Verify It Works

After deployment, check:
1. `https://your-app.vercel.app` â†’ Should show ContextFlow
2. Open browser console â†’ No 404 errors (except LaunchDarkly is fine)
3. Dashboard should load with sample data

## If Still Getting 404

1. **Check Build Logs** in Vercel:
   - Look for "Build failed" or error messages
   - Common: Missing OPENAI_API_KEY during build

2. **Environment Variable**:
   - Must be in Production environment
   - Must redeploy after adding

3. **Framework Setting**:
   - Should be "Next.js" not "Other"

4. **Node Version**:
   - Vercel uses Node 18+ by default
   - This project is compatible

## The Root Cause

The original 404 was caused by:
- Dynamic imports with SSR disabled can fail in production
- Missing 'use client' directive for React hooks
- .jsx extension sometimes causes import issues in Next.js

All fixed now! ðŸš€
